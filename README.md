# Free-Code-Camp
FreeCodeCamp is a self-paced code camp where you work your way towards their own front-end and back-end developer certificates. Along the way they have an array of different challenges for you to solve as well as projects. I'll be keeping my projects and solutions here on github once I've finished them.
